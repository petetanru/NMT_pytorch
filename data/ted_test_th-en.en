What I want to talk about is, as background,
is the idea that cars are art.
This is actually quite meaningful to me,
because car designers tend to be a little bit low on the totem pole --
we don't do coffee table books with just one lamp inside of it --
and cars are thought so much as a product
that it's a little bit difficult to get into the aesthetic side
under the same sort of terminology that one would discuss art.
And so cars, as art, brings it into an emotional plane -- if you accept that --
that you have to deal with on the same level you would with art with a capital A.
Now at this point you're going to see a picture of Michelangelo.
This is completely different than automobiles.
Automobiles are self-moving things, right? Elevators are automobiles.
And they're not very emotional; they solve a purpose;
and certainly automobiles have been around for 100 years
and have made our lives functionally a lot better in many ways;
they've also been a real pain in the ass,
because automobiles are really the thing we have to solve.
We have to solve the pollution, we have to solve the congestion --
but that's not what interests me in this speech.
What interests me in this speech is cars. Automobiles may be what you use,
but cars are what we are, in many ways.
And as long as we can solve the problems of automobiles,
and I believe we can, with fuel cells or hydrogen, like BMW is really hip on,
and lots of other things, then I think we can look past that
and try and understand why this hook is in many of us --
of this car-y-ness -- and what that means, what we can learn from it.
That's what I want to get to. Cars are not a suit of clothes;
cars are an avatar. Cars are an expansion of yourself:
they take your thoughts, your ideas, your emotions, and they multiply it --
your anger, whatever. It's an avatar.
It's a super-waldo that you happen to be inside of, and if you feel sexy,
the car is sexy. And if you're full of road rage,
you've got a "Chevy: Like a Rock," right?
Cars are a sculpture -- did you know this?
That every car you see out there is sculpted by hand.
Many people think, "Well, it's computers,
and it's done by machines and stuff like that."
Well, they reproduce it, but the originals are all done by hand.
It's done by men and women who believe a lot in their craft.
And they put that same kind of tension into the sculpting of a car
that you do in a great sculpture that you would go and look at in a museum.
That tension between the need to express, the need to discover,
then you put something new into it,
and at the same time you have bounds of craftsmanship.
Rules that say, this is how you handle surfaces;
this is what control is all about; this is how you show you're a master of your craft.
And that tension, that discovery, that push for something new --
and at the same time, that sense of obligation
to the regards of craftsmanship --
that's as strong in cars as it is in anything.
We work in clay, which hasn't changed much
since Michelangelo started screwing around with it,
and there's a very interesting analogy to that too.
Real quickly -- Michelangelo once said he's there to "discover the figure within," OK?
There we go, the automobile.
That was 100 years right there -- did you catch that?
Between that one there, and that one there, it changed a lot didn't it?
OK, it's not marketing; there's a very interesting car concept here,
but the marketing part is not what I want to talk about here.
I want to talk about this.
Why it means you have to wash a car, what is it, that sensuality
you have to touch about it? That's the sculpture that goes into it. That sensuality.
And it's done by men and women working just like this, making cars.
Now this little quote about sculpture from Henry Moore,
I believe that that "pressure within" that Moore's talking about --
at least when it comes to cars --
comes right back to this idea of the mean.
It's that will to live, that need to survive, to express itself,
that comes in a car, and takes over people like me.
And we tell other people, "Do this, do this, do this," until this thing comes alive.
We are completely infected. And beauty can be the result
of this infectiousness; it's quite wonderful.
This sculpture is, of course, at the heart of all of it,
and it's really what puts the craftsmanship into our cars.
And it's not a whole lot different, really, when they're working like this,
or when somebody works like this.
It's that same kind of commitment, that same kind of beauty.
Now, now I get to the point. I want to talk about cars as art.
Art, in the Platonic sense, is truth; it's beauty, and love.
Now this is really where designers in car business diverge from the engineers.
We don't really have a problem talking about love.
We don't have a problem talking about truth or beauty in that sense.
That's what we're searching for --
when we're working our craft, we are really trying to find that truth out there.
We're not trying to find vanity and beauty.
We're trying to find the beauty in the truth.
However, engineers tend to look at things a little bit more Newtonian,
instead of this quantum approach.
We're dealing with irrationalisms,
and we're dealing with paradoxes that we admit exist,
and the engineers tend to look things a little bit more like
two and two is four, and if you get 4.0 it's better, and 4.000 is even better.
And that sometimes leads to bit of a divergence
in why we're doing what we're doing.
We've pretty much accepted the fact, though,
that we are the women in the organization at BMW --
BMW is a very manly type business, -- men, men, men; it's engineers.
And we're kind of the female side to that. That's OK,
that's cool. You go off and be manly. We're going to be a little bit more female.
Because what we're interested in is finding form that's more than just a function.
We're interested in finding beauty that's more than just an aesthetic;
it's really a truth.
And I think this idea of soul, as being at the heart of great cars,
is very applicable. You all know it. You know a car when you've seen it,
with soul. You know how strong this is.
Well, this experience of love, and the experience of design, to me,
are interchangeable. And now I'm coming to my story.
I discovered something about love and design through a project called Deep Blue.
And first of all, you have to go with me for a second, and say,
you know, you could take the word "love" out of a lot of things in our society,
put the word "design" in, and it still works,
like this quote here, you know. It kind of works, you know?
You can understand that. It works in truisms.
"All is fair in design and war."
Certainly we live in a competitive society.
I think this one here, there's a pop song
that really describes Philippe Starck for me, you know, this is like
you know, this is like puppy love, you know, this is cool right?
Toothbrush, cool.
It really only gets serious when you look at something like this. OK?
(Laughter)
This is one substitution that I believe
all of us, in design management, are guilty of.
And this idea that there is more to love,
more to design, when it gets down to your neighbor, your other,
it can be physical like this, and maybe in the future it will be.
But right now it's in dealing with our own people,
our own teams who are doing the creating. So, to my story.
The idea of people-work is what we work with here,
and I have to make a bond with my designers when we're creating BMWs.
We have to have a shared intimacy, a shared vision --
that means we have to work as one family;
we have to understand ourselves that way.
There's good times; there's interesting times;
and there's some stress times too.
You want to do cars, you've got to go outside.
You've got to do cars in the rain; you've got to do cars in the snow.
That's, by the way, is a presentation we made to our board of directors.
We haul their butts out in the snow, too. You want to know cars outside?
Well, you've got to stand outside to do this.
And because these are artists, they have very artistic temperaments.
All right? Now one thing about art is, art is discovery,
and art is discovering yourself through your art. Right?
And one thing about cars is we're all a little bit like Pygmalion,
we are completely in love with our own creations.
This is one of my favorite paintings, it really describes our relationship with cars.
This is sick beyond belief.
(Laughter)
But because of this, the intimacy with which we work together as a team
takes on a new dimension, a new meaning.
We have a shared center; we have a shared focus --
that car stays at the middle of all our relationships.
And it's my job, in the competitive process, to narrow this down.
I heard today about Joseph's death genes
that have to go in and kill cell reproduction.
You know, that's what I have to do sometimes.
We start out with 10 cars; we narrow it down to five cars,
down to three cars, down to two cars, down to one car,
and I'm in the middle of that killing, basically.
Someone's love, someone's baby.
This is very difficult, and you have to have a bond with your team
that permits you to do this, because their life is wrapped up in that too.
They've got that gene infected in them as well,
and they want that to live, more than anything else.
Well, this project, Deep Blue, put me in contact with my team
in a way that I never expected, and I want to pass it on to you,
because I want you to reflect on this, perhaps in your own relationships.
We wanted to a do a car which was a complete leap of faith for BMW.
We wanted to do a team which was so removed from the way we'd done it,
that I only had a phone number that connected me to them.
So, what we did was: instead of having a staff of artists that are just your wrist,
we decided to free up a team of creative designers and engineers
to find out what's the successor to the SUV phenomenon in America.
This is 1996 we did this project. And so we sent them off with this team name,
Deep Blue. Now many people know Deep Blue from IBM --
we actually stole it from them because we figured
if anybody read our faxes they'd think we're talking about computers.
It turned out it was quite clever because Deep Blue,
in a company like BMW, has a hook -- "Deep Blue," wow, cool name.
So people get wrapped up in it. And we took a team of designers,
and we sent them off to America. And we gave them a budget,
what we thought was a set of deliverables,
a timetable, and nothing else.
Like I said, I just had a phone number that connected me to them.
And a group of engineers worked in Germany,
and the idea was they would work separately
on this problem of what's the successor to the SUV.
They would come together, compare notes. Then they would work apart,
come together, and they would produce together
a monumental set of diverse opinions that didn't pollute each other's ideas --
but at the same time came together and resolved the problems.
Hopefully, really understand the customer at its heart,
where the customer is, live with them in America. So -- sent the team off,
and actually something different happened. They went other places.
(Laughter)
They disappeared, quite honestly, and all I got was postcards.
Now, I got some postcards of these guys in Las Vegas,
and I got some postcards of these guys in the Grand Canyon,
and I got these postcards of Niagara Falls,
and pretty soon they're in New York, and I don't know where else.
And I'm telling myself, "This is going to be a great car,
they're doing research that I've never even thought about before."
Right? And they decided that instead of, like, having a studio,
and six or seven apartments,
it was cheaper to rent Elizabeth Taylor's ex-house in Malibu.
And -- at least they told me it was her house,
I guess it was at one time, she had a party there or something.
But anyway, this was the house, and they all lived there.
Now this is 24/7 living, half-a-dozen people who'd left their --
some had left their wives behind and families behind,
and they literally lived in this house
for the entire six months the project was in America,
but the first three months were the most intensive.
And one of the young women in the project,
she was a fantastic lady, she actually built her room in the bathroom.
The bathroom was so big, she built the bed over the bathtub --
it's quite fascinating.
On the other hand, I didn't know anything about this. OK?
Nothing. This is all going on, and all I'm getting is postcards
of these guys in Las Vegas, or whatever,
saying, "Don't worry Chris, this is really going to be good." OK?
So my concept of what a design studio was probably --
I wasn't up to speed on where these guys were.
However, the engineers back in Munich
had taken on this kind of Newtonian solution,
and they were trying to find how many cup holders
can dance on the head of a pin, and, you know,
these really serious questions that are confronting the modern consumer.
And one was hoping that these two teams would get together,
and this collusion of incredible creativity,
under these incredible surroundings,
and these incredibly stressed-out engineers,
would create some incredible solutions.
Well, what I didn't know was, and what we found out was --
these guys, they can't even like talk to each other under those conditions.
You get a divergence of Newtonian and quantum thinking at that point,
you have a split in your dialog that is so deep, and so far,
that they cannot bring this together at all.
And so we had our first meeting, after three months, in Tiburon,
which is just up the road from here -- you know Tiburon?
And the idea was after the first three months of this independent research
they would present it all to Dr. Goschel --
who is now my boss, and at that time he was co-mentor on the project --
and they would present their results.
We would see where we were going,
we would see the first indication of what could be
the successive phenomenon to the SUV in America.
And so I had these ideas in my head, that this is going to be great.
I mean, I'm going to see so much work, it's so intense --
I know probably Las Vegas meant a lot about it,
and I'm not really sure where the Grand Canyon came in either --
but somehow all this is going to come together,
and I'm going to see some really great product.
So we went to Tiburon, after three months,
and the team had gotten together the week before,
many days ahead of time.
The engineers flew over, and designers got together with them,
and they put their presentation together.
Well, it turns out that the engineers hadn't done anything.
And they hadn't done anything because --
kind of, like in car business, engineers are there to solve problems,
and we were asking them to create a problem.
And the engineers were waiting for the designers to say,
"This is the problem that we've created, now help us solve it."
And they couldn't talk about it. So what happened was,
the engineers showed up with nothing.
And the engineers told the designers,
"If you go in with all your stuff, we'll walk out,
we'll walk right out of the project."
So I didn't know any of this,
and we got a presentation that had an agenda, looked like this.
There was a whole lot of dialog.
We spent four hours being told all about vocabulary
that needs to be built between engineers and designers.
And here I'm expecting at any moment, "OK, they're going to turn the page,
and I'm going to see the cars, I'm going to see the sketches,
I'm going to see maybe some idea of where it's going."
Dialog kept on going, with mental maps of words, and pretty soon
it was becoming obvious that instead of being dazzled with brilliance,
I was seriously being baffled with bullshit.
And if you can imagine what this is like,
to have these months of postcard indication of how great this team is working,
and they're out there spending all this money, and they're learning,
and they're doing all this stuff.
I went fucking ballistic, right? I went nuts.
You can probably remember Tiburon, it used to look like this.
After four hours of this, I stood up, and I took this team apart.
I screamed at them, I yelled at them, "What the hell are you doing?
You're letting me down, you're my designers,
you're supposed to be the creative ones,
what the hell is going on around here?"
It was probably one of my better tirades, I have some good ones,
but this was probably one of my better ones. And I went into these people;
how could they take BMW's money,
how could they have a holiday for three months and produce nothing, nothing?
Because of course they didn't tell us that they had three station wagons
full of drawings, model concepts, pictures -- everything I wanted,
they'd locked up in the cars, because they had shown solidarity with the engineers --
and they'd decided not to show me anything,
in order to give the chance for problem solving a chance to start,
because they hadn't realized, of course,
that they couldn't do problem creating.
So we went to lunch --
(Laughter)
And I've got to tell you, this was one seriously quiet lunch.
The engineers all sat at one end of the table,
the designers and I sat at the other end of the table, really quiet.
And I was just fucking furious, furious. OK?
Probably because they had all the fun and I didn't, you know.
That's what you get furious about right?
And somebody asked me about Catherine, my wife, you know,
did she fly out with me or something?
I said, "No," and it triggered a set of thoughts about my wife.
And I recalled that when Catherine and I were married,
the priest gave a very nice sermon, and he said something very important.
He said, "Love is not selfish," he said,
"Love does not mean counting how many times I say, 'I love you.'
It doesn't mean you had sex this many times this month,
and it's two times less than last month,
so that means you don't love me as much.
Love is not selfish." And I thought about this, and I thought,
"You know, I'm not showing love here. I'm seriously not showing love.
I'm in the air, I'm in the air without trust.
This cannot be. This cannot be that I'm expecting a certain number of sketches,
and to me that's my quantification method for qualifying a team.
This cannot be."
So I told them this story. I said, "Guys, I'm thinking about something here,
this isn't right. I can't have a relationship with you guys
based on a premise that is a quantifiable one.
Based on a dictate premise that says, 'I'm a boss, you do what I say, without trust.'"
I said "This can't be."
Actually, we all broke down into tears, to be quite honest about it,
because they still could not tell me how much frustration they had built up
inside of them, not being able to show me what I wanted,
and merely having to ask me to trust them that it would come.
And I think we felt much closer that day,
we cut a lot of strings that didn't need to be there,
and we forged the concept for what real team and creativity is all about.
We put the car back at the center of our thoughts, and we put love,
I think, truly back into the center of the process.
By the way, that team went on to create six different concepts
for the next model of what would be the proposal
for the next generation after SUVs in America.
One of those was the idea of a crossover coupes --
you see it downstairs, the X Coupe -- they had a lot of fun with that.
It was the rendition of our motorcycle,
the GS, as Carl Magnusson says, "brute-iful,"
as the idea of what could be a motorcycle, if you add two more wheels.
And so, in conclusion, my lesson that I wanted to pass on to you,
was this one here. I'm also going to steal a little quote out of "Little Prince."
There's a lot to be said about trust and love,
if you know that those two words are synonymous for design.
I had a very, very meaningful relationship with my team that day,
and it's stayed that way ever since.
And I hope that you too find that there's more to design,
and more towards the art of the design, than doing it yourself.
It's true that the trust and the love, that makes it worthwhile.
Thanks so much.
(Applause)
If you take 10,000 people at random, 9,999 have something in common:
their interests in business lie on or near the Earth's surface.
The odd one out is an astronomer, and I am one of that strange breed.
(Laughter)
My talk will be in two parts. I'll talk first as an astronomer,
and then as a worried member of the human race.
But let's start off by remembering that Darwin showed
how we're the outcome of four billion years of evolution.
And what we try to do in astronomy and cosmology
is to go back before Darwin's simple beginning,
to set our Earth in a cosmic context.
And let me just run through a few slides.
This was the impact that happened last week on a comet.
If they'd sent a nuke, it would have been rather more spectacular
than what actually happened last Monday.
So that's another project for NASA.
That's Mars from the European Mars Express, and at New Year.
This artist's impression turned into reality
when a parachute landed on Titan, Saturn's giant moon.
It landed on the surface. This is pictures taken on the way down.
That looks like a coastline.
It is indeed, but the ocean is liquid methane --
the temperature minus 170 degrees centigrade.
If we go beyond our solar system,
we've learned that the stars aren't twinkly points of light.
Each one is like a sun with a retinue of planets orbiting around it.
And we can see places where stars are forming,
like the Eagle Nebula. We see stars dying.
In six billion years, the sun will look like that.
And some stars die spectacularly in a supernova explosion,
leaving remnants like that.
On a still bigger scale, we see entire galaxies of stars.
We see entire ecosystems where gas is being recycled.
And to the cosmologist,
these galaxies are just the atoms, as it were, of the large-scale universe.
This picture shows a patch of sky
so small that it would take about 100 patches like it
to cover the full moon in the sky.
Through a small telescope, this would look quite blank,
but you see here hundreds of little, faint smudges.
Each is a galaxy, fully like ours or Andromeda,
which looks so small and faint because its light
has taken 10 billion light-years to get to us.
The stars in those galaxies probably don't have planets around them.
There's scant chance of life there -- that's because there's been no time
for the nuclear fusion in stars to make silicon and carbon and iron,
the building blocks of planets and of life.
We believe that all of this emerged from a Big Bang --
a hot, dense state. So how did that amorphous Big Bang
turn into our complex cosmos?
I'm going to show you a movie simulation
16 powers of 10 faster than real time,
which shows a patch of the universe where the expansions have subtracted out.
But you see, as time goes on in gigayears at the bottom,
you will see structures evolve as gravity feeds
on small, dense irregularities, and structures develop.
And we'll end up after 13 billion years
with something looking rather like our own universe.
And we compare simulated universes like that --
I'll show you a better simulation at the end of my talk --
with what we actually see in the sky.
Well, we can trace things back to the earlier stages of the Big Bang,
but we still don't know what banged and why it banged.
That's a challenge for 21st-century science.
If my research group had a logo, it would be this picture here:
an ouroboros, where you see the micro-world on the left --
the world of the quantum -- and on the right
the large-scale universe of planets, stars and galaxies.
We know our universes are united though --
links between left and right.
The everyday world is determined by atoms,
how they stick together to make molecules.
Stars are fueled by how the nuclei in those atoms react together.
And, as we've learned in the last few years, galaxies are held together
by the gravitational pull of so-called dark matter:
particles in huge swarms, far smaller even than atomic nuclei.
But we'd like to know the synthesis symbolized at the very top.
The micro-world of the quantum is understood.
On the right hand side, gravity holds sway. Einstein explained that.
But the unfinished business for 21st-century science
is to link together cosmos and micro-world
with a unified theory -- symbolized, as it were, gastronomically
at the top of that picture. (Laughter)
And until we have that synthesis,
we won't be able to understand the very beginning of our universe
because when our universe was itself the size of an atom,
quantum effects could shake everything.
And so we need a theory that unifies the very large and the very small,
which we don't yet have.
One idea, incidentally --
and I had this hazard sign to say I'm going to speculate from now on --
is that our Big Bang was not the only one.
One idea is that our three-dimensional universe
may be embedded in a high-dimensional space,
just as you can imagine on these sheets of paper.
You can imagine ants on one of them
thinking it's a two-dimensional universe,
not being aware of another population of ants on the other.
So there could be another universe just a millimeter away from ours,
but we're not aware of it because that millimeter
is measured in some fourth spatial dimension,
and we're imprisoned in our three.
And so we believe that there may be a lot more to physical reality
than what we've normally called our universe --
the aftermath of our Big Bang. And here's another picture.
Bottom right depicts our universe,
which on the horizon is not beyond that,
but even that is just one bubble, as it were, in some vaster reality.
Many people suspect that just as we've gone from believing
in one solar system to zillions of solar systems,
one galaxy to many galaxies,
we have to go to many Big Bangs from one Big Bang,
perhaps these many Big Bangs displaying
an immense variety of properties.
Well, let's go back to this picture.
There's one challenge symbolized at the top,
but there's another challenge to science symbolized at the bottom.
You want to not only synthesize the very large and the very small,
but we want to understand the very complex.
And the most complex things are ourselves,
midway between atoms and stars.
We depend on stars to make the atoms we're made of.
We depend on chemistry to determine our complex structure.
We clearly have to be large, compared to atoms,
to have layer upon layer of complex structure.
We clearly have to be small, compared to stars and planets --
otherwise we'd be crushed by gravity. And in fact, we are midway.
It would take as many human bodies to make up the sun
as there are atoms in each of us.
The geometric mean of the mass of a proton
and the mass of the sun is 50 kilograms,
within a factor of two of the mass of each person here.
Well, most of you anyway.
The science of complexity is probably the greatest challenge of all,
greater than that of the very small on the left
and the very large on the right.
And it's this science,
which is not only enlightening our understanding of the biological world,
but also transforming our world faster than ever.
And more than that, it's engendering new kinds of change.
And I now move on to the second part of my talk,
and the book "Our Final Century" was mentioned.
If I was not a self-effacing Brit, I would mention the book myself,
and I would add that it's available in paperback.
(Laughter)
And in America it was called "Our Final Hour"
because Americans like instant gratification.
(Laughter)
But my theme is that in this century,
not only has science changed the world faster than ever,
but in new and different ways.
Targeted drugs, genetic modification, artificial intelligence,
perhaps even implants into our brains,
may change human beings themselves. And human beings,
their physique and character, has not changed for thousands of years.
It may change this century.
It's new in our history.
And the human impact on the global environment -- greenhouse warming,
mass extinctions and so forth -- is unprecedented, too.
And so, this makes this coming century a challenge.
Bio- and cybertechnologies are environmentally benign
in that they offer marvelous prospects,
while, nonetheless, reducing pressure on energy and resources.
But they will have a dark side.
In our interconnected world, novel technology could empower
just one fanatic,
or some weirdo with a mindset of those who now design computer viruses,
to trigger some kind on disaster.
Indeed, catastrophe could arise simply from technical misadventure --
error rather than terror.
And even a tiny probability of catastrophe is unacceptable
when the downside could be of global consequence.
In fact, some years ago, Bill Joy wrote an article
expressing tremendous concern about robots taking us over, etc.
I don't go along with all that,
but it's interesting that he had a simple solution.
It was what he called "fine-grained relinquishment."
He wanted to give up the dangerous kind of science
and keep the good bits. Now, that's absurdly naive for two reasons.
First, any scientific discovery has benign consequences
as well as dangerous ones.
And also, when a scientist makes a discovery,
he or she normally has no clue what the applications are going to be.
And so what this means is that we have to accept the risks
if we are going to enjoy the benefits of science.
We have to accept that there will be hazards.
And I think we have to go back to what happened in the post-War era,
post-World War II, when the nuclear scientists
who'd been involved in making the atomic bomb,
in many cases were concerned that they should do all they could
to alert the world to the dangers.
And they were inspired not by the young Einstein,
who did the great work in relativity, but by the old Einstein,
the icon of poster and t-shirt,
who failed in his scientific efforts to unify the physical laws.
He was premature. But he was a moral compass --
an inspiration to scientists who were concerned with arms control.
And perhaps the greatest living person
is someone I'm privileged to know, Joe Rothblatt.
Equally untidy office there, as you can see.
He's 96 years old, and he founded the Pugwash movement.
He persuaded Einstein, as his last act,
to sign the famous memorandum of Bertrand Russell.
And he sets an example of the concerned scientist.
And I think to harness science optimally,
to choose which doors to open and which to leave closed,
we need latter-day counterparts of people like Joseph Rothblatt.
We need not just campaigning physicists,
but we need biologists, computer experts
and environmentalists as well.
And I think academics and independent entrepreneurs
have a special obligation because they have more freedom
than those in government service,
or company employees subject to commercial pressure.
I wrote my book, "Our Final Century," as a scientist,
just a general scientist. But there's one respect, I think,
in which being a cosmologist offered a special perspective,
and that's that it offers an awareness of the immense future.
The stupendous time spans of the evolutionary past
are now part of common culture --
outside the American Bible Belt, anyway --
(Laughter)
but most people, even those who are familiar with evolution,
aren't mindful that even more time lies ahead.
The sun has been shining for four and a half billion years,
but it'll be another six billion years before its fuel runs out.
On that schematic picture, a sort of time-lapse picture, we're halfway.
And it'll be another six billion before that happens,
and any remaining life on Earth is vaporized.
There's an unthinking tendency to imagine that humans will be there,
experiencing the sun's demise,
but any life and intelligence that exists then
will be as different from us as we are from bacteria.
The unfolding of intelligence and complexity
still has immensely far to go, here on Earth and probably far beyond.
So we are still at the beginning of the emergence of complexity
in our Earth and beyond.
If you represent the Earth's lifetime by a single year,
say from January when it was made to December,
the 21st-century would be a quarter of a second in June --
a tiny fraction of the year.
But even in this concertinaed cosmic perspective,
our century is very, very special,
the first when humans can change themselves and their home planet.
As I should have shown this earlier,
it will not be humans who witness the end point of the sun;
it will be creatures as different from us as we are from bacteria.
When Einstein died in 1955,
one striking tribute to his global status was this cartoon
by Herblock in the Washington Post.
The plaque reads, "Albert Einstein lived here."
And I'd like to end with a vignette, as it were, inspired by this image.
We've been familiar for 40 years with this image:
the fragile beauty of land, ocean and clouds,
contrasted with the sterile moonscape
on which the astronauts left their footprints.
But let's suppose some aliens had been watching our pale blue dot
in the cosmos from afar, not just for 40 years,
but for the entire 4.5 billion-year history of our Earth.
What would they have seen?
Over nearly all that immense time,
Earth's appearance would have changed very gradually.
The only abrupt worldwide change
would have been major asteroid impacts or volcanic super-eruptions.
Apart from those brief traumas, nothing happens suddenly.
The continental landmasses drifted around.
Ice cover waxed and waned.
Successions of new species emerged, evolved and became extinct.
But in just a tiny sliver of the Earth's history,
the last one-millionth part, a few thousand years,
the patterns of vegetation altered much faster than before.
This signaled the start of agriculture.
Change has accelerated as human populations rose.
Then other things happened even more abruptly.
Within just 50 years --
that's one hundredth of one millionth of the Earth's age --
the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere started to rise,
and ominously fast.
The planet became an intense emitter of radio waves --
the total output from all TV and cell phones
and radar transmissions. And something else happened.
Metallic objects -- albeit very small ones, a few tons at most --
escaped into orbit around the Earth.
Some journeyed to the moons and planets.
A race of advanced extraterrestrials
watching our solar system from afar
could confidently predict Earth's final doom in another six billion years.
But could they have predicted this unprecedented spike
less than halfway through the Earth's life?
These human-induced alterations
occupying overall less than a millionth of the elapsed lifetime
and seemingly occurring with runaway speed?
If they continued their vigil,
what might these hypothetical aliens witness
in the next hundred years?
Will some spasm foreclose Earth's future?
Or will the biosphere stabilize?
Or will some of the metallic objects launched from the Earth
spawn new oases, a post-human life elsewhere?
The science done by the young Einstein will continue
as long as our civilization, but for civilization to survive,
we'll need the wisdom of the old Einstein --
humane, global and farseeing.
And whatever happens in this uniquely crucial century
will resonate into the remote future and perhaps far beyond the Earth,
far beyond the Earth as depicted here.
Thank you very much.
(Applause)
